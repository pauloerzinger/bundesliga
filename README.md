VanHack Project - Bundesliga

Requirements:

PHP 7.1
Laravel 5.4

Setup:

1. Simply download contents to computer;
2. Acess folder in comand-line and type php artisan serve;
3. In default configurations, website will be at http://localhost:8000/

Description:

I have choosen PHP with Laravel Framework because it delivers powerful tools ready to use, making development faster and easier. Also, it handles the model layer praticly by itself. However I didn't need it. In case I need to add new functionalities I have everything already in place to do it. Very smooth and easy.

For styling I did use Bootstrap v4, which is a huge helper to build fast front-end, specially for developers who don't have too much knowledge of design (my case).

Workflow:

I have opted not to use persistent data (databases) because I wanted to keep the website with updated info, and I didn't feel the need to store data that I will need to review all the time. Instead, I worked with arrays storing the contents returned by the API, and formatting the way I needed to use.
